# You can approximate Pi by using the following series:
#pi = 4 * (1 - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) - (1/11) + ... + ((-1)**(i+1) / (2*i - 1)) )


num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms to use: "))

pi_sum = 0

for i in range(1, num_terms+1):
    term = (-1)**(i+1) / (2*i - 1)
    pi_sum += term
pi = 4 * pi_sum
