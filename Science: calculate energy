# Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final
#temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is  Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
#where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.

m= eval(input("Enter the amount of water in kilograms:"))
initialTemperature = eval(input("Enter the initial temperature:"))
finalTemperature = eval(input("Enter the final temperature:"))
q = m * (finalTemperature-initialTemperature) * 4184
print(f"The energy needed is {q}")
