#5.18/page161
# Write a program that reads an integer and displays all its smallest factors, also known as prime factors.
#For example, if the input integer is 120, the output should be as follows: 2, 2, 2, 3, 5

num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
factor = 2  #smallest prime factor

while factor * factor <= num:
    if num % factor == 0:
        print(factor, end=", ")
        num //= factor
    else:
        if factor == 2:
            factor = 3
        else:
            factor += 2

print(num)
