# Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
#take off using the following formula: length = (v**2)/(2*a)
#Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in meters/second squared and displays the minimum runway length.

v,a = eval(input("Enter speed and acceleration: "))
length = (v**2)/(2*a)

print(f"The minimum runway length for this airplane is {length:.3f} meters")
