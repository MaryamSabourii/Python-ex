# Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate and computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user enters 10 for 
# the subtotal and 15% for the gratuity rate, the program displays 1.5 as the gratuity and 11.5 as the total.

s,g = eval(input("Enter the subtotal and a gratuity rate:"))
gratuity = (s*g)/100
total = s + gratuity
print(f"The gratuity is {gratuity:.2f} and the total is {total:.2f}")
