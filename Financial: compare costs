# Suppose you shop for rice and find it in two differentsized packages. You would like to write a program to compare the costs of the packages.
#The program prompts the user to enter the weight and price of each package and then displays the one with the better price

weight2,price2 = eval(input("Enter weight and price for package 2: "))
